c
The two latches 8 and 10 flip their value if the input 2 is high.
They only exhibit this behavior after an initialization phase of 2 steps,
where they are reset to 0. The difference in implementation is that 8
references both bits of the saturating initialization counter (4 and 6),
while 10 only checks the most significant (6).
