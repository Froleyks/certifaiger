Don't execute these scripts.
They are copied to the bin directory by cmake, run them from there.

The scripts (in increasing order of specificity to my workflow):
- check <model> <witness>
  Calls certifaiger to generate the SAT formulas and asserts unsatisfiabilty using kissat.
- certified <model checker> <model> [<model checker args>]
  Runs the model checker and checks the resulting witness with check or aigsim. Respects environment variable MC_TIMEOUT.
- random <model checker> [<seed>]
  Generates a random model using aigfuzz with options FUZZER_OPTIONS and runs certified model checker.
- fuzz <model checker>
  Repeatedly runs random and keeps track of some statistics.
  Continues to run for FAILURES many invalid wertificates.
- status
  Parses fuzz logfiles and prints the statistics
- certifuzzer <model checker> [<cores>=8]
  Sets up the option fuzzing (requires --ranges to be implemented in the model check) and runs fuzz in parallel.
- annotate <model> <witness> produces the combined witness check for an invalid witness and annotates it with the identified model. Requires no reencoding at aigtocnf.c:283.
