Don't execute these scripts.
They are copied to the build directory by cmake, run them from there.

The scripts (in increasing order of specificity to my workflow):
- check <model> <witness>
  Calls certifaiger to generate the SAT formulas and asserts unsatisfiabilty using kissat.
- certified <model checker> <model> [--mc_time=<limit>] [<model checker args>]
  Runs the model checker and checks the resulting witness with check or aigsim.
- random <model checker> [<seed>]
  Generates a random model using aidfuzz and runs certified model checker
- fuzz <model checker>
  Repeatedly runs random and keeps track of some statistics.
- status
  Parses fuzz logfiles and prints the statistics
- certifuzzer <model checker> [<cores>=8]
  Sets up the option fuzzing (requires --ranges to be implemented in the model check) and runs fuzz in parallel.
