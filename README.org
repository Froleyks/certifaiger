** Motivation
Model checking is an essential technique for hardware design.
For unsafe circuits, those that violate the property being checked, it is usually easy to produce a trace to demonstrate the flaw.
In cases where the model checking succeeds, a certificate should be produced that proves the property indeed holds for all possible traces.
We propose /witness circuits/ as a format for these certificates.
A witness circuit generalizes the concept of an inductive invariant.

Instead of searching for an inductive invariant in the model itself, we find a different circuit -- the witness -- that simulates part of the model and has an inductive invariant.
** Witness circuits
To check if a witness circuit is valid for a given model, Certifaiger performs five checks.
For an AIGER circuit $M$ we use
$R, C, P, F$
to refer to the symbolic formulas encoding that:
- The latches in $L$ are in their reset.
- All constraints hold.
- The property holds on the inputs and latches in $I \cup L$, i.e. the /bad/ or /output/ is not set.
- The latches in $L_1$ are equal to the /next/ of the matching latch in $L_0$. The two copies of the latches and inputs also implicitly define two temporal copies of the other formulas, i.e., $R_0$, $R_1$, $C_0, C_1, \dots$

These formulas can be encoded as combinatorial AIGER circuits by replacing latches with inputs, resulting in a DAG with a single output and leaves ending in inputs or constants.

Note that we use a (slightly) modified version of the AIGER 1.9 format.
Our witness circuits may require the use of /reset functions/,
that is, latches may be reset to other latches or gates,
instead of just constants (or staying uninitialized).

For a model $M$ and witness circuit $M'$,
let $R, C, F, P, I, L$ and their primed version be the formulas from above and the set of all inputs and latches in the respective circuit,
$K$ is the intersection of latches and inputs between the two.
The five checks are:
| Reset      | $R\{K\} \wedge C \Rightarrow R'\{K\} \wedge C'$              |
| Transition | $F\{K\} \wedge C_0 \wedge C_1 \wedge C_0' \Rightarrow F'\{K\} \wedge C_1'$ |
| Property   | $(C \wedge C') \Rightarrow (P \Rightarrow P')$                |
| Base       | $R' \wedge C' \Rightarrow P'$                       |
| Step       | $P_0' \wedge F' \wedge C_0' \wedge C_1' \Rightarrow P_1'$         |

For a witness and model that pass the first three checks, the witness is said to simulate the model.
The last two check the inductiveness of the property in the witness circuit.

The validity of these formulas is checked by encoding their negation into combinatorial circuits, translated to CNF using [[https://github.com/arminbiere/aiger][aigtocnf]], and checking unsatisfiability with [[https://github.com/arminbiere/kissat][Kissat]] or any other SAT solver.
The produced certificates of unsatisfiability may additionally be checked by a [[https://satcompetition.github.io/2023/downloads/proposals/drat_dpr.pdf][verified proof checker]].
The entire certificate check is coNP in the size of the circuits.
** Witness Format
Witness circuits are normal AIGER circuits in either ASCII or binary format.

Both the Reset and Transition checks are defined on the set of intersecting inputs and latches $M$.
Requiring the witness circuit to keep the same variable indexing for $M$ would lead to gaps in the variable indexing.
This, in turn, would prohibit storing the witness in the binary format since it requires the inputs and latches to be indexed consecutively before any gate.
Instead, the witness can store an explicit mapping of its inputs and latches to the simulated literals in the model in its symbol table.
Other information may be stored, but for elements of $M$ the /name/ must start with '=' followed by the simulated literal in the model.
#+begin_example
l0 = 2
l1 = 4
c
WITNESS o0 model.aig shasum 9f1747da5a7dd981c9dac13f4077c8e31c9ce50d
#+end_example
To allow the translation between the two formats without breaking the mapping, Certifaiger enforces consecutive indexing for inputs and latches, even in ASCII format.

While not required, it is recommended to include a comment starting with 'WITNESS' followed by the property being certified and the name of the model file. Additionally, a hash may be included.

If no mapping information is found, Certifaiger assumes that
the first $n$ inputs in the model are simulated by the first $n$ inputs in the witness, and the first $m$ latches by the first $m$ latches in the witness.
The first bad or in the absence of that the first output is certified.

** Quantified Checks
By default Certifaiger produces checks as AIGER ceircuits which are then translated to CNF formulas. When specifying the /--qbf/ option, some of the checks might be expressed as
[[https://github.com/ltentrup/QAIGER][QAIGER]] circuit which are translated to QBF formulas. The quantified checks are weaker, i.e., it might be easier to find a witness that passes them. However this comes at significantly higher computational cost.
For the same reason Certifaiger employs a number of heuristic to use as few quantified checks as possible.

The table below lists the relaxed versions of each check together with the maximum number of quantifier alternations that can be specified (/--qbf 2 2 1 0 1/ the same is achieved with just --qbf).

| Reset      | 2 | $R \wedge C \Rightarrow \exists X'\forall O.(R' \wedge C')$                      |
| Transition | 2 | $F \wedge C_0 \wedge C_1 \wedge C_0' \Rightarrow \exists X_1'\forall O_1.(F' \wedge C_1')$ |
| Property   | 1 | $C \wedge \neg P \Rightarrow \exists X'\forall O.(C' \wedge \neg P')$                  |
| Base       | 0 | $R' \wedge C' \Rightarrow P'$                                   |
| Step       | 1 | $\forall O.(P_0' \vee \neg C_0') \wedge C_0' \wedge F' \wedge C_1' \Rightarrow P_1'$  |

Here $X$ refers to the parts of the witness circuit not in the model and $O$ refers to the set of /oracles/ discussed later. Before we need to discuss /stratified/ reset functions which enable the quantifier free version of the reset check.
** Stratified Reset
A circuit is said to be stratified if the syntactic dependency graph induced by its reset function is acyclic.
This is usually not a big restriction and fairly common in practice.
Since in the original AIGER format latches can only be reset to constants, stratification is trivial.
The /semantic dependency graph/ is the subset of the syntactic dependency graph,
where an edge $(a, b)$ indicates that
an assignment exists where a change in $b$ would imply a change in $a$.

If the witness circuit is stratifed,
the Reset check above ensures that the set of shared latches $M$ is at the bottom of the semantic dependency graph of $R'$,
i.e., the reset of the latches in $M$ depends only on $M$.
It follows that any reset of $M$ can be extended to a reset of $L'$.

If the witness circuit is not stratified, it is not guaranteed that a partial reset can be extended.
Therefore, Certifaiger will fail certification if the polynomial stratification test fails and /--qbf 1/ is not specified.
** Oracles
Witness circuits can designate a subset of their inputs as oracles. Oracles allow to reason about sets of extensions in the witness for a single state in the model. The relaxed version of the step check above takes advantage of that by only requiring a next state to be save if all states in the class induced by the oracles on the current state are save.
#+begin_example
i1 oracle
i2 oracle
#+end_example

The only model checking technique that requires oracles we have encountered so far is k-induction under uniqueness constants.
For a $k$-inductive model $M=(I,L,R,F,P,C)$, a valid witness $W=(I',O',L,R,F,P',C')$ may be constructed with I' = I^{0} \cup \dots \cup I^{k-1} where I^{0} = I, O' = I' \ I;
P' = \wedge_{i\in[0,k)} P_{i}, and C' = \wedge_{i\in[0,k)} C_{i}.
A witness resulting form this construction can be found in the examples directory.
